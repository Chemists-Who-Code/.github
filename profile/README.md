# Welcome!

This organization is for a workshop put together by a group of interdisciplinary graduate students at Colorado School of Mines called Chemists who Code. Chemists who Code works to help young scientist, or professionals learn how they can use programming to streamline their research or administrative tasks. Apart from workshops at Mines, Chemists who Code offers monthly "office hours" where people with programming experience provide one on one assistance for specific challenges. All experience levels are welcome at both workshops and office hours. Participants have ranged from never having seen code before to developing their own software packages. Workshops are geared towards bringing people up to speed on the basics of python so that it can be used a tool for data analysis and plotting using packages like numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

# Where to start if you're interested!

## Workshops

We are currently working to make a a Summer '25 workshop a posibility, but currently do not have a date set. If you are interested in the materials from the previous workshop (Summer '24) we recomend you [start here](https://github.com/Mines-Python-Workshop/Python_Workshop_Materials). The materials should walk you through everything from setting up your computer to run python, to doing basic plotting. These materials are designed to be worked through independently, but this was a first attempt at making this so do no hesitate to reach out if something is confusing or seems to not be working.

## Office Hours

Chemists who Code is not currently holding office hours over the summer. Office hours are typically held during on the last Friday of the month at 11:00 am MST. Anyone is welcome. Members are happy to provide help and input on research questions, and how coding might be useful. Office hours have been attended by people who 

## Getting Involved

Currently we are a small team and apprecite any help or feedback. If you have suggestions for code feel free to add an issue to the respective repository, or even fork and make the change yourself.

If you are interested in helping in a bigger way, or getting involved, feel free to email Ben at chemists_who_code.surface871@passmail.net.

# Metrics and Endorsements

A survey was sent out 8 months after the first; it recieved 20-25 responses for a range of questions to evaluate the workshop fills demand. The table below are how those participants felt about the workshop.

Below are testimonials from real people who attended Chemists who Code office hours.

> 'I came to the Chemists Who Code office hours to get help finding the inverse of a complex fitting function that I was using to fit experimental data. Multiple people helped me with my code and brainstormed with me potential solutions for the problems I was encountering. The ideas and advice I got during office hours set me on a path that eventually led to my code being successful.'

> 'I received help in writing a code to analyze some data that would have otherwise taken me over an hour to covert. I now use this program whenever I run a particular instrument and it streamlines my data analysis process.'

> 'They were so helpful and worked one on one with me to teach me how to do specific things that led to much more efficiency. Thanks!!'
